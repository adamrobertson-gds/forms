## Key Headlines

- When there is missing information, GOV.UK Forms can make a big difference to processing time for these forms.
- Even compared to straightforward, complete forms, GOV.UK Forms still saves time
- Existing forms completed correctly: 24 seconds saved per form (on average) - 36% faster
- Forms with errors or missing information: 67 seconds saved per form (on average) - 55% faster
- Potential time saved per year for this form: 51 hours (2,750 forms p.a. with a 67 second saving per form)
- SCOOs claim that GOV.UK Forms output would be easier to read and process if there was clearer delineation between questions and responses
- The addition of subject line would make the process more efficient for SCOOs.  It would allow them to store forms and organise them with unique names/subjects. Ideally this would have: Name of form (Volunteer to be a Coastguard), Area team, Applicant name.
- Having form completers answer to email questions formatted as mailto: links makes it convenient to use them to make contact.
